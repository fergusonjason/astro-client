# typescript-with-react

Having just finished a React class, it was time to create a project with it before I forgot everything. However, the class was taught
using Javascript, as opposed to my preferred Typescript. It was also taught with Bootstrap, while I deifinitely prefer the
Material UI libraries.

And, to be honest, I think I still prefer Angular. Time will tell.

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
